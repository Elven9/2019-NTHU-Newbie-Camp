# To teach any newbie programming language, there is an adorable, honourable 
# tradition: Hello World Program

# First task we want a computer to do for us is probably displaying some 
# information that is useful to us. Since GUI Program is not easy to write 
# and not effortless to try to beautify it, shell, or terminal naturally 
# becomes the best option for beginner to pratice their first program

# Say Hello To Programming World!!
print("Hello World")

# Or show the world today's weather
print("Mostly Cloudy, Today, Shinchu City.")

# 當然，你要打中文，什麼文也可以，Python 用的編碼模式是可以接受各國語言的的
# Emoji will work too.
print("我喜歡打 Python")
print("私はPythonが好きです")
print("🍱🎉⛩")

# 當然，要用 Format 的話也可以
